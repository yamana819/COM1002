* **Book Exercises:** Solutions to problems found in the Deitel & Deitel textbook.
* **Lab Works:** Time-constrained problems solved during laboratory sessions.

## 🧠 Key Concepts
This repository includes practices on:
* **Structured Programming:** Functions, arrays, and control structures.
* **Memory Management:** Pointers, dynamic memory allocation (malloc, calloc, free).
* **Data Structures:** Structs, Linked Lists, Stacks (Introductory level).
* **File Processing:** Reading from and writing to files in C.

## ⚙️ Compilation
